# Webauxillary

Why should i use a Node.js emulator?

## Heres why node.js emulator

If you use a hosting service you usually cant use node, for example Vercel has node, but limited, and Functions are a really bad part of serverless

Or.. you dont want to deal with a VPS, i get that, its frustrating to use a VPS instead of actually just using the npm package privately, thats where Verdaccio comes in,

Verdaccio is helpful for Webauxillary using Node plugins, Verdaccio is actually private, and it actually was proven to be a private registry

## Okay.. So what? Each node emulator cant emulate node COMPLETELY

That's where you are wrong, Webauxillary is a CDN that is USEFUL for node emulation COMPLETELY using Verdaccio, Browserify, JS-DOS, and Webpack, each giving a virtual browser emulation

(Not simulation) of what would be called the future.
